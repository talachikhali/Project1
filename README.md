# Project1
A little on the project:
we have a robot , it needs to walk 10 steps to get to the box
in th e box we have tringles, circles and squares , that are represented by this list:[["Tringle","Red"],["Circle","Blue"],["Tringle","Green"],["Square","Red"],["Circle","Red"],["Square","Green"],["Tringle","Blue"],["Circle","Green"],["Square","Blue"]]
depending on what it sees , it has to sort them in the boxes
it will take 10 steps regardless 
then depending on the index of the box it will take the extra steps 
then returns to the beginning
it repeats this steps until the box is empty and sorted in the right boxes
